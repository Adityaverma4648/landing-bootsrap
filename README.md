# login_registration
 using php , scss , js
 The front end was created using boosrap which I started learning recently.
 In this PHP project ,I focused on getting the user register or login to my credit card product landing page...
         if the user not registered i.e if the user tries to login without registering backend redirects user to registration page.
         And if the user tries to register using the same Email id then backend directs user to loggin page with a message that user is already registered.
